    luca: `Luca Moretti ‚Äî "The Prodigy Who Never Peaked"

They said he would be the next great Italian rider ‚Äî the reincarnation of Coppi or Pantani. But fame came too fast, too early. A few junior trophies, a front-page Giro crash, and Luca vanished. Years later, he's back ‚Äî grizzled, bitter, brilliant. This is his second chance, and in his mind, it's now or never.

Assigned to Team Rubicon, Luca knows he's not here to play second fiddle. He respects the team, of course, but deep down, this Tour isn't about synergy ‚Äî it's about redemption. The world has forgotten his name, but he's ready to make them remember. One perfect breakaway. One unstoppable surge. That's all it will take.`,

    jonas: `Jonas Dahl ‚Äî "The Domestique Turned Dissident"

For a decade, Jonas poured sweat and strategy into other riders' victories. He gave up breakaways, sabotaged his own time trials, and kept captains safe from wind and harm. But after a betrayal in his final Tour, he retired quietly‚Ä¶ or so they thought.

This time, with Team Rubicon, things are different. There's no one to protect ‚Äî no one to lead out. This is his turn to be the tip of the spear. Jonas won't waste energy on sentiment. He sees the Grand Tour Gamble as a strategic puzzle ‚Äî and he plans to win it, move by calculated move.`,

    mateo: `Mateo Silva ‚Äî "The Wildcard With a Chip on His Shoulder"

Mateo never fit the mold ‚Äî Brazilian, working-class, cocky, and always clashing with coaches. He won races not by numbers but by intuition and guts. After being dropped by two teams for insubordination, he vanished into underground street cycling. That's where they found him.

Team Rubicon might be structured, but Mateo sees the Gamble as a stage for something bigger. Not just points or podiums ‚Äî legacy. If he times it right, this will be the ride that silences the haters and makes him a legend.`,

    kenji: `Kenji Nakamura ‚Äî "The Strategist With Something to Prove"

Kenji was the analyst everyone wanted on their team ‚Äî calculating, composed, always two moves ahead. But after a public feud with a famous team manager, he left pro cycling and turned to game design and AI modeling. The Grand Tour Gamble intrigued him not for glory, but for the pure logic of it.

Joining Team Rubicon, he's prepared to play the long game ‚Äî quietly biding his time until the moment is right. He sees the Gamble as a perfect setup: controlled chaos, ripe for disruption. This isn't about teamwork; this is a personal equation, and Kenji plans to solve it with precision and perfect timing.`
