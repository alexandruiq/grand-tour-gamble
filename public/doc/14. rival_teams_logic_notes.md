# Rival Teams Logic & Supabase Integration

## Integration Notes

- **No new tables required**: Use a static markdown or JSON for rival team bios.
- **Scores**: Pull from existing `calculateStageResults.ts` logic.
- **Leaderboard**: Integrate with Rubicon logic to show relative placement of Solaris, Corex, Vortex. (do not show the strategy % of each team to the users)
- **Scoring Logic**: Use fixed AI strategy:
  - Solaris: 70% Cruise / 30% Sprint
  - Corex: 50% Cruise / 50% Sprint
  - Vortex: 30% Cruise / 70% Sprint

## Supabase Ties
- All results and scores come from `decisions_log`, filtered by team.
- Rivals treated as virtual users (auto-generated decisions on stage start).
- AI logic injected via Edge Function.

## Cursor Tips
- Use static `rival_teams.md` for story modals.
- Use Realtime subs for scores if scoreboard is live.
- Rival team identity is cosmetic â€” logic already handled in backend.
