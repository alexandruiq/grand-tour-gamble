# 🧑‍🏫 Component Prompt: Trainer Debrief – Solo vs. Team Outcomes

## 🎯 Purpose
Build a **Trainer-Facing Debrief Component** shown after Stage 10 to analyze and present:
- **Overall team collaboration trends**
- **Individual vs. collective performance**
- **Learning opportunities and behavior patterns**
This view helps the trainer lead a powerful post-game reflection session.

## 🧩 Component Goals
- Aggregate **team scores**, **individual outliers**, **synergy levels**, and **stamina usage**.
- Highlight **top scorers** who may have harmed team synergy.
- Show **which team(s) won**, and how their strategy compares to Team Rubicon.
- Equip the trainer with **discussion prompts**.

## 🖼️ UI Layout Suggestions
- **Header**: “Team Debrief Summary”
- **Team Leaderboard**: Placement, points, synergy

- **Synergy timeline** over 10 stages
- **Stamina bar per cyclist** showing fatigue progression
