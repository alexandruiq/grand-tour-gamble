The Grand Tour Gamble – History & Legacy
(Loading Page .txt file)

In a sport where tradition is sacred and every move is analyzed, a bold experiment shattered expectations. A secret coalition of retired cyclists, master tacticians, and behavioral scientists designed a new kind of competition — one that wouldn't just test strength and stamina, but force riders to confront their deepest motivations.

They called it The Grand Tour Gamble.

Held once a year on ever-changing routes across the globe, the Gamble isn't like any other race. There are no established favorites, no team captains, no fixed alliances. What it demands from riders isn't just physical excellence, but nerve, foresight, and the courage to choose between team loyalty and personal ambition.

In this race, every stage is a fork in the road: Sprint ahead and claim points — but burn precious energy and risk alienating others. Cruise in sync with your fellow riders — and hope the favor is returned. Sometimes it is. Sometimes… it isn’t.

Riders from all corners of the world have learned that reputation, negotiation, and timing matter just as much as raw talent. Legends have been made from daring solo breaks — and others broken by misplaced trust or mistimed aggression.

Now it’s your turn.

You and your group will take the reins of a single rider from the mysterious Team Rubicon. Each decision you make will ripple through the race. Will you play safe, build alliances, and wait for the perfect moment — or take bold risks and race into the unknown?

Ten stages. Dozens of choices. One legacy.  
Welcome to The Grand Tour Gamble.
