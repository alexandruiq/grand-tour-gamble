# The Grand Tour Gamble — Player Rules (Updated)

Welcome to The Grand Tour Gamble, where your group of participants will manage a single cyclist in Team Rubicon. Every stage, you’ll choose whether your cyclist Sprints or Cruises — and your decision will affect not just your individual score, but your team’s final standing in a world-class competition against three rival teams.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Your Group's Goal**: Maximize your cyclist’s performance and final score over 10 stages.
- **Team Rubicon's Goal**: Outscore the rival teams (Solaris, Corex, Vortex) using collaboration, strategy, and stamina management.

---

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

### ✅ Actions per Stage
Each stage, you must decide:
- **Sprint (Y)** — Push hard, gain points, but spend stamina.
- **Cruise (X)** — Ride steady, safer for stamina and team coordination.

### 🔄 Scoring Matrix

| Cyclist Choices | Points (Cruisers) | Points (Sprinters) |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 4 X              | +1 each           | —                   |
| 3 X, 1 Y         | -1 each X         | +3 for Y            |
| 2 X, 2 Y         | -2 each X         | +2 each Y           |
| 1 X, 3 Y         | -3 for X          | +1 each Y           |
| 4 Y              | —                 | -1 each             |

---

## 💪 Stamina System

- **Starting Stamina**: Each cyclist begins with **5 stamina points**.
- **Sprinting**: -1 stamina per sprint.
- **No Stamina**: Sprinting is unavailable when stamina = 0. Must choose Cruise.
- **Recovery**: Cruising restores +1 stamina per stage if synergy is high.
- **Stamina Cap**: Maximum 5 stamina.

---

## 🧠 Synergy Mechanic

- **Synergy Score**: Team Rubicon earns synergy points per stage (range: 0–100).

| Combination     | Synergy Effect |
|----------------|----------------|
| 4 Cruise (X)    | +20            |
| 3 X, 1 Y        | +10            |
| 2 X, 2 Y        | 0              |
| 1 X, 3 Y        | -10            |
| 4 Y             | -20            |

**Effects of Synergy**:
- Faster stamina recovery
- Multiplier boost after negotiations
- Better team-wide performance messages
- Visible to players as a "Synergy Meter"

---

## 🗣️ Negotiation Rounds

You’ll meet at:
- **Before Stage 4**
- **Before Stage 7**
- **Before Stage 9**

During negotiation, each group discusses whether to Sprint or Cruise. If coordination is reached, a **points multiplier** is applied in the next stage.

| Alignment Level   | Multiplier |
|-------------------|------------|
| 3 groups aligned  | x1.5       |
| 4 groups aligned  | x2.0       |

---

## 🧠 Penalties & Restrictions

| Situation                    | Effect             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| 0 stamina                   | Cannot sprint - must cruise |
| Sprint while others Cruise  | -1 synergy stage   |
| Multiple consecutive Sprints| No recovery next stage |

---

## 🤖 Rival Teams (AI)

| Team    | Behavior Profile         |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Solaris | Cooperative (70% Cruise) |
| Corex   | Balanced (50/50)         |
| Vortex  | Aggressive (70% Sprint)  |

These teams use the same logic, scoring rules, and matrix as Team Rubicon and compete in the global leaderboard.
