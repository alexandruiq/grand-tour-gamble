# /admin — Session Creation Page

This is the entry point for trainers to create a new game session of *The Grand Tour Gamble*. It is separate from the trainer's live control dashboard and should be kept minimal and focused on configuration.

---

## 🛠️ Page Purpose

Allow trainers to:
- Configure a new game session
- Generate a unique session code
- Define basic setup (e.g. team size, session label)
- Redirect into the trainer dashboard `/trainer/[sessionId]` once ready

---

## 📋 UI Elements

### 1. `Session Name` Input
- Text input (e.g. “Soft Skills July Session”)
- Stored as `session_name` in Supabase

### 2. `Number of Cyclists` Dropdown
- Default: 4
- Optional field to customize how many players will join (used for validation or visual feedback)
- Stored as `expected_players` or `cyclists_count`

### 3. `Create Session` Button
- Triggers Supabase `insert` into `sessions` table
- Generates:
  - UUID (`sessionId`)
  - Human-readable code (`trainer_code`) – 6 characters alphanumeric
  - Created timestamp

### 4. `Confirmation Card`
- Upon success, display:
  - Session Name
  - Trainer Code
  - Button: `Go to Trainer Dashboard`

---

## 🔁 Behavior

- After pressing **Create Session**:
  - Save data to Supabase
  - Redirect to `/trainer/[sessionId]`

- On page load:
