# The Grand Tour Gamble — Player Rules

Welcome to The Grand Tour Gamble, where each group of players manages one cyclist within Team Rubicon. Your decisions — whether to Sprint or Cruise — will shape not only your cyclist’s success, but also the fate of your team and its standing against three rival teams.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- **Your group's goal**: Maximize your cyclist's score over 10 stages.
- **Team Rubicon's goal**: Outperform all rival teams based on the total score of all 4 cyclists.

---

## 🕹️ Game Mechanics

### ✅ Actions per Stage
At each of the 10 stages, your group will choose:
- **Sprint (Y)** or **Cruise (X)**

Your choice affects your stamina and the team dynamic.

### 🔄 Decision Matrix (Per Stage)

| Cyclist Choices | Points (Cruisers) | Points (Sprinters) |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 4 X              | +1 each           | —                   |
| 3 X, 1 Y         | -1 each X         | +3 for Y            |
| 2 X, 2 Y         | -2 each X         | +2 each Y           |
| 1 X, 3 Y         | -3 for X          | +1 each Y           |
| 4 Y              | —                 | -1 each             |

## 🏁 Stamina
- Each Sprint depletes stamina by 1.
- If your cyclist runs out of stamina, they must Cruise until recovery.
- Consecutive Sprints cause faster burnout.

---

## 🔄 Negotiation
You’ll meet at **3 key moments** during the tour (e.g. before Stages 4, 7, and 9).
Discuss with the other groups whether to Cruise or Sprint.
- After each negotiation phase, a **points multiplier** is applied for the next stage (x1.5 or x2).

---

## 🤝 Synergy Mechanic
Team Rubicon’s overall synergy improves with cooperation.
- If most cyclists Cruise, your cyclist recovers stamina faster.
- If one sprints while others cruise, trust drops and progress suffers.
- Your total score contributes directly to **Team Rubicon’s total**.

---

## 🏆 Scoring & Leaderboard

- Each cyclist’s score is tracked live.
- Team Rubicon’s total = sum of the 4 cyclist scores.
- Competing teams (Solaris, Corex, Vortex) follow the same scoring logic.
- Final rankings show **Team Placement** and **Individual Standings**.

---

## 🚨 Penalties & Restrictions
- No Stamina: Sprinting is unavailable when stamina = 0.
- Mismatch: Sprinting when others Cruise = trust penalty.
- Collaboration failure = lower team synergy.

---

## 🎓 Reflection & Debrief
At the end of Stage 10, you'll review:
- Your cyclist's final score.
- Team Rubicon’s final placement.
- The impact of your choices on team dynamics.
