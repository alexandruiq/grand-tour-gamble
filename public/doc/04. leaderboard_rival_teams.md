# Team Leaderboard & Rivals ‚Äî Display Components

In each stage and at the end of the game, the leaderboard system will reflect both:

## üèÜ Team Leaderboard (Cycling Teams)

Each team is made up of 4 cyclists:

| Rank | Team Name    | Total Points |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1    | Team Rubicon | XXXX         |
| 2    | Solaris      | XXXX         |
| 3    | Corex        | XXXX         |
| 4    | Vortex       | XXXX         |

- **Team Rubicon**: Managed by players. Each cyclist controlled by a different group.
- **Rival Teams** (AI controlled):
  - **Solaris**: Cooperative (70% Cruise)
  - **Corex**: Balanced (50/50)
  - **Vortex**: Aggressive (70% Sprint)

The scoring system for all teams is identical and follows the main decision matrix.

## üö¥ Individual Cyclist Leaderboard

This ranks the performance of each cyclist across all teams:

| Rank | Cyclist Name       | Team        | Points |
|------|--------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1    |                   |             |        |
| 2    |                   |             |        |
| 3    |                   |             |        |
| ‚Ä¶    |                   |             |        |
| 16   |                   |             |        |

- Names and points update live after each stage.
- Allows players to track personal progress relative to all competitors.
- Useful for reflection and analysis at the end of the game.

## üîÑ How It Works

- Scores update after each stage based on actions and multipliers.
- Team scores = sum of their 4 cyclists.
- Individual leaderboard = direct ranking based on cyclist points.
- Trainers can optionally display these live or in key moments.
