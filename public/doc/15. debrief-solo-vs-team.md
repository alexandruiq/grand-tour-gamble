# 🎯 Component Prompt: Debrief Solo vs. Team

## 🔍 Purpose
Build a **Debrief Component** shown after Stage 10 that helps users **compare their individual performance** against their **team’s outcome**, and **analyze tradeoffs** between playing selfishly vs. collaboratively.

## 📊 Component Goals
- Help users reflect on the **impact of their choices** (Sprint vs. Cruise).
- Show **solo score vs. team score** visually.
- Include synergy and stamina info to reveal hidden costs.
- Trigger a discussion on **"winning alone vs. losing together."**

## 🖼️ UI Layout (Flexible)
- **Header**: "Your Race Debrief — Solo vs. Team"
- **Cyclist Summary Card**: Name, Final Points, # of Sprints/Cruises
- **Team Summary Box**:
  - Team Rubicon Placement (1st–4th)
  - Total Team Points
  - Final Synergy Score (0–100)
- **Comparative Insights**:
  - Were you the top scorer in your team?
  - Did the team lose despite your good score?
  - Did synergy drop due to sprinting?
  - Was your final stamina low?

## 📘 Sample Reflections (text logic)
If solo score is high but team lost:
> "You played like a champion — but your team finished 3rd. Your sprint strategy paid off in points, but drained synergy and left the team behind."

If solo score is mid and team wins:
> "Steady pacing and synergy brought your team to the top. You may not have sprinted ahead, but your collaboration won the race."

If solo and team both score high:
> "Well done — you found the sweet spot between personal glory and team strategy. The perfect ride."
